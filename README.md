#Basic Math Operations Chatbot

This Python code implements a basic math operations chatbot that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two operands. The chatbot interacts with users through the command line interface and responds to user input in natural language.

##Dependencies
The code uses the built-in 're' module to validate user input and perform small talk.

##Functions
The code includes several functions:

* 'add(num1, num2)' adds two numbers and returns the result
* 'subtract(num1, num2)' subtracts two numbers and returns the result

*'multiply(num1, num2)' multiplies two numbers and returns the result

* 'divide(num1, num2)' divides two numbers and returns the result or an error message if the denominator is zero

* 'small_talk(sentence)' handles small talk with users and responds appropriately

* 'main()' is the main function that handles user input, performs math operations, and prompts the user to continue or exit

* 'chatbot()' is the entry point for the chatbot and initializes the conversation with a greeting and a prompt

##Usage
To use the chatbot, run the chatbot() function in the Python interpreter or from the command line. The chatbot will prompt the user to enter a mathematical operation and two operands, perform the operation, and display the result. The user can choose to perform another operation or exit the chatbot.

The chatbot also handles small talk and responds to user input that contains greetings or other keywords. If the user enters an invalid operation or an invalid input, the chatbot prompts the user to enter a valid input.
